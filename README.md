## Overview

The Amazon Fine Food Reviews Sentiment Analysis project focuses on developing a sentiment analysis model to classify user reviews as positive or negative based on their ratings. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, contains a significant number of reviews along with various attributes.

## Project Structure

- **Notebooks:** Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
- **Data:** Holds the dataset used in the project (not included in this repository due to its size).
- **Models:** Includes saved models or model-related files.
- **Results:** Contains output files, visualizations, and performance metrics.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, tqdm, beautifulsoup4, gensim

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash

   ```

3. Execute the Jupyter notebooks in the `Notebooks` directory in the specified order.

## Results

Detailed results, including model performance metrics and insights, can be found in the project notebooks.

## Future Directions

Explore potential improvements, such as ensemble methods, further hyperparameter tuning, and advanced embeddings, as outlined in the notebooks.
